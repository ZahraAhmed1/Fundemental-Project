## Overview 

I created a CRUD web application which uses everything learnt so far. Some are implemented and some are not. The web application is for neurodivergent people to share their experiences in life.

### Trello Board

Here is my Trello board including the User Stories, Backlog and a section with everything that is completed

### Entity Relation Diagram

Here is my ERD. It is a many to many relationship for Users and Experiences However this was not fully implemented but will be with completion of the web application.

### Risk Assessment

Here are some risks that need to be considered. Since the web application is not finished and only at the beginning stages most of the Risks are not yet implimented however they will be in the near future.

## CRUD within the application

Create - Users can create their own account. The next step would be for users to create their own experiences.

Read - Users can read posts including the post of other users within the web application. They should also be able to read other users profiles without reading their address. This is not yet implemented as there are currently no users.

Update - Users can update their passwords and create a new one. When the experience page is done users should be able to edit and update their old experiences however they should not be able to update other user experiences.

Delete - Users can delete their account and should be able to delete their experiences but there are currently no users so there is nothing to delete. Deleting should also redirect you to the page "No user found".

## Future Improvements

This is a very basic web application but as I advance in my DevOps studies I can create a more advanced version. 
One of the things will be to add a captcha to log in so bots cant get into and flood the database. 
Another thing will be to advance each CRUD layer and the html files.
